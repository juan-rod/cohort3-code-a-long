  In this example, the first row track is set to have a minimum height of 100px, 
  but its maximum size of auto will allow the row track to grow it the content is taller than 100px.
  The first column track has a minimum size of auto, but its maximum size of 50% will prevent 
  it from getting no wider than 50% of the grid container width. */
